DBIx::SearchProfiles
====================

Version: 0.11

Description
-----------

DBIx::SearchProfiles is a module which wraps around a DBI database
handle and provides another way than raw SQL to access the database.
Its aims is to take the SQL out of the code in well defined and
documented search profiles which are easier to maintain than embedded
SQL all over the application. Moreover, this decoupling of the
application logic from the SQL programming makes it possible to review
the SQL by a DBA which might not be a programmer. It may also makes
the application's code more obvious and clearer which is a Good
Thing (tm)

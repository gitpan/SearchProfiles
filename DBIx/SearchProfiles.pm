=head1 NAME

DBIx::SearchProfiles - Access to SQL database via template query.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DBIx::SearchProfiles;

    my $DB = new DBIx::SearchProfiles( $dbh, $profiles);

    my $record  = $DB->record_get( "customer", 1024 );

    my $records = $DB->template_search( "cust_low_balance",
					{ low_balance => 50 } );

    $DB->record_insert( "customer", $customer_data );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBIx::SearchProfiles is a module which wraps around a DBI database
handle and provides another way than raw SQL to access the database.
Its aims is to take the SQL out of the code in well defined and
documented search profiles which has easier to maintain than embedded
SQL all over the application. Moreover, this decoupling of the
application logic from the SQL programming makes it possible to review
the SQL by a DBA which might not be a programmer. It may also makes
the application's code more obvious and clearer which is a Good
Thing (tm)

=head1 ACCESS METHODS

The DBIx::SearchProfiles module offers three method of access to
the underlying database :

=over

=item RAW SQL ACCESS

This is the lowest level and is thin wrapper around the underlying DBI
methods. The caller specifies the SQL statement and the params to use
for the query.

    Ex: $DB->sql_insert( "INSERT INTO customer (?,?,?)", @params );

=item RECORD ACCESS

This class of access generates automatically the SQL statement to use
based on the fields present in the table and the fields passed as
parameters. This type of access is very handy for insert or update where
you don't want to specify all the fields.

    Ex: $DB->record_insert( "customer", $customer_data );

Where I<customer> is the name of the profile definition to use and
$customer_data is a reference to an hash which contains the customer's
infos.


=item TEMPLATE ACCESS

This is the most interesting type of access. The problem with the
previous type of access is that it is convenivent and efficient for
simple query but when you want something more complex it fails
miserably. (Say one where you want other operators than =, and where
you are joining 6 tables together) In the template based access, you
use a template query in which the parameters will be substituted. The
query can be as complex as you want and the parameter subsitutions
also.

    Ex: $DB->template_search( "troublesome_customers", $search_spec );

=back

Each class of access provides 5 methods to access the data. (SQL has
an extra one, but its the exception) :

=over

=item *_get

The C<*_get> methods ( C<sql_get()>, C<record_get()> and
C<template_get()> ) will return only one record in the form of an hash
reference. Each keys corresponds to one column of the table. (So two
columns must not have the same name.)

=item *_search

The C<*_search> methods (C<sql_search()>, C<record_search()> and
C<template_search()>) will return a reference to an array of hash.
Each hash is a table row where the keys are the column's names.

Also the C<record_search()> and C<template_search()> methods have support
for limiting the number of rows returned and to results offset.
(1-50,51-100,etc).


=item *_insert

The C<*_insert> methods are for inserting one record in a table.

=item *_update

The C<*_update> methods are for updating records in a table.

=item *_delete

The C<*_delete> methods are for deleting records from the table.

=back

=head1 INITIALIZATION

To get a database search profiles handle, you use the C<new> method. 

    Ex: my $DB = new DBIx::SearchProfiles( $dsn, $profiles );

The $dsn parameter can either be an already connected DBI handle or a
reference to an hash which contains three parameters I<DataSource>,
I<UserName> and I<Password> which will be used to open one. Note that
on destruction, the connection will only be closed if the connection
was established by the DBIx::SearchProfiles modules.

The $profiles parameter can either be a reference to an hash which
contains the search profiles, or the name of a file which will be
evaluated and that must return a reference to an hash which will
contains the search profiles. Note that whenever the search profiles'
file changes on disk, the profiles are reloaded.

=cut

sub new {
    my $proto = shift;
    my $class = ref $proto || $proto;

    my $dsn		= shift;
    my $profiles	= shift;

    my $self = {};
    if ( ref $dsn eq "HASH" ) {
	my $dbh = DBI->connect( $dsn->{DataSource}, $dsn->{UserName},
				$dsn->{Password}, { RaiseError => 1, } );
	$self->{dbh}	= $dbh;
	$self->{did_connect} = 1;
    } else {
	$self->{dbh} = $dsn;
    }

    # Oracle workaround
    $self->{support_limit} = $self->{dbh}{Driver}{Name} !~ /Oracle/;

    my $profiles_file = undef;
    unless ( ref $profiles eq "HASH" ) {
	$profiles_file = $profiles;
	$profiles = undef;
    }
    $self->{profiles}	    = $profiles;
    $self->{profiles_file}  = $profiles_file;

    bless $self, $class;
}

sub DESTROY {
    my $self = shift;

    # Disconnect from database, if we opened the connection.
    if ( $self->{did_connect} ) {
	$self->{dbh}->disconnect;
    }
}

=pod

=head1 DBI WRAPPER METHODS

=head2 commit

Simply call commit on the underlying DBI handle.

=cut

sub commit {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->{dbh}->commit;
}

=pod

=head2 rollback

Simply call rollback on the underlying DBI handle.

=cut

sub rollback {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->{dbh}->rollback;
}

=head1 PROFILE DEFINITIONS

A search profiles collection is a reference to an hash where each key points
ta profile definition. A search profile definition is an hash which contains
several elements which will be used to build query automatically.

Here is an example profiles :

    {
    category	    =>
	{
	    query   => q{ SELECT id,category FROM category 
			  WHERE category_id = ? },
	    params  => [ "category_id" ],
	},
    product_srch    =>
      {
       query	    => q{ SELECT DISTINCT code,code_manu,category_id,category,
				 manufacturer_id,manufacturer,
				 price,description 
			  FROM products p ,manufacturer m ,category c
			  WHERE ( ? = -1 OR c.id  = ? )    AND
				( ? = -1 OR m.id  = ? )	   AND
				category_id = c.id	   AND
				manufacturer_id = m.id	   AND
				( code = ? OR code_manu    = ?
					   OR category     LIKE ?
					   OR manufacturer LIKE ?
					   OR description  LIKE ?
				)
			 },
       params	    => [ qw( category_id category_id manufacturer_id
			     manufacturer_id
			     search search search search search ) ],
       order	    => "category_id,manufacturer_id,code",
       defaults	    => { category_id => -1, manufacturer_id => -1 },
       limit	    => 25,
      },
    order_items	    =>
      {
       fields	 => [qw( quantity subtotal ) ],
       keys	 => [ qw( order_no code ) ],
       table	 => "order_items",
      },
    }

In this example, you have a simple query profile (category), a complex
template search (product_srch) and an example of a profile for record based 
access.

Here is the meaning of the different fields :

=over

=item table (RECORD ACCESS ONLY)

The name of the table on which we will operate.

=item keys (RECORD ACCESS ONLY)

A reference to an array which contains the name of the fields which
are the primary key for the table.

=item fields (RECORD ACCESS ONLY)

A reference to an array which contains the name of the fields which
are not primary keys in the table.

=item defaults

Reference to an hash of parameter defaults. This will be used to
complete when no values are present. 

=item limit

Used by C<record_search> and C<template_search> as the default
number of records to return at a time for this query.

=item max

Used by C<record_search> and C<template_search> as the default
maximum total number of records to return for a query.

=item order

Used by C<record_search> and C<template_search> as the default ordering
for the query.

=item query (TEMPLATE ACCESS ONLY)

This is the query template. It should contains the SQL that will be
executed with the standard DBI (?) placeholders embedded in it.

=item params (TEMPLATE ACCESS ONLY)

A reference to an array which contains the name of the params that will
be substituted in the template. There should be one element for every
placeholder in the query.

=head1 RECORD BASED ACCESS

=over

=head2 record_get ( $name, params );

This method will return an hash reference to a record. The first argument
is the name of the profile where the table information will be found. The params argument can either be :

=over

=item ARRAY OR ARRAY REF

Each element of the array is mapped to an element of the I<keys> field
of the profile. It is an error if the number of elements is different than
the number of keys defined in the table.

=item HASH REF

The key will be built by using the name of the keys as specified in the
I<keys> field of the profile, or by using the I<defaults> hash if present.

It is an error if some portion of the key is missing.

=head2 record_search ( $name, \%params );

This method will build a search on the table specified in the profile
$name. $params is a reference to an hash where each keys that is
present in the I<fields> or I<keys> of the profile will be used as a
constraint in the query. The test is for equality, if you want
something more complex, use C<template_search>.

There are a few magic parameters :

=over

=item dbix_sp_order

Will override the order clause of the query. If not present the I<order>
field of the profile will be used.

=item dbix_sp_limit

Limit the number of records returned by the query. If not present the
I<limit> field of the profile will be used.

=item dbix_sp_max

Set the maximum number of records that the query may fetch, this override
the I<max> field of the profile but cannot be set higher.

=item dbix_sp_start

If there is a I<limit> set for the query, this parameter will start
returning records from that offset in the result. Offset is 0 indexed.

=back

The I<params> argument is modified on return. Here is a list of the
modified elements :

=over

=item dbix_sp_found

The number of record returned.

=item dbix_sp_total

The total number of record matching the query.

=back

Like all *_search methods C<record_search> will return a reference to
an array of hash.

=head1 TEMPLATE BASED ACCESS

All of the C<template_*> methods accepts two parameters, $name and
params. The $name parameter specified the profile to use as a template
for the operation (get,search,insert,update or delete). The other
parameter is used as substitutions for the placeholders of the
template. Those substitutions can be specified in three manners :

=over

=item ARRAY OR ARRAY REF

Each element of the array is mapped to an element of the I<params> field
of the profile. It is an error if the number of elements is different than
the number of params defined in the profile.

=item HASH REF

Each substitutions will be mapped to one of the element of the
I<params> hash in the order specified by the I<params> element of the
profile. If a params element isn't present, a default one will be
used. (Either the value specified in the profile's defaults element or
NULL).

=back

=head2 template_get ( $name, params )

This method will return an hash reference to a record using the
profile $name.

=head2 template_search ( $name, params )

This method will run a search using the query template specified in
the profile named $name and return the results in a reference to an
array of hashes.

This methods accept the same magic parameters in the %params element
as the C<record_search> method. It also modifies the same element in
%params as that method.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

Please report bugs, suggestions, patches and thanks to <bugs@iNsu.COM>.

The search limitations and offset SQL generation is probably not completely
portable. It uses LIMIT which is not supported in SQL92 but PostgreSQL and 
MySQL supports it. There is a workaround for Oracle.

To find the number of records that will be returned by a query (in
*_search) we use C<count(*)>. This could cause a number of problems.
